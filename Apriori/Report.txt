2- My project can solve that market basket problems but I
can find only frequent 1-itemsets.

3- I created a function to read from txt file for transactions.
Then I added all transactions into a multidimensional array.
This array is dynamic. So even if txt file change, my algorithm
can work purely. After that process, I counted support numbers
of all items and I add items that can satisfy the minimum
support into an ArrayList. Finally, I converted to a dynamic
multidimensional array.

4- The aim of this program is find all frequent 1-itemsets.

5- Double, String, Integer, Multidimensional Array, ArrayList,
Arrays, RandomAccessFile, BufferedReader, Exception, Map and
HashMap are used in my Apriori algorithm.

6-  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException // like all Java codes
    public static String[][] readFileIntoMultiDimensionalArray(String inputFile) throws IOException
    public static int getMaxNumberOfLines(String inputFile)
    public static Map<String, Double> countFrequencies(ArrayList<String> list)
    public static ArrayList<String> frequentOneItemset(Map<String, Double> map)
    public static String[][] convertArrayListToMultiDimensionalArray(ArrayList<String> arrayList)


7- No, there is no bug in my algorithm.

8- You only change variable that is called textFile.
You have to write path of your txt file.

9- Sample output is in rar file.
