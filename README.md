## Apriori Folder
In this section, there is an algorithm which is called *Apriori* and it was written in Java. The algorithm is tested with 3 different transaction lists and also there is a report by reported in a file with txt extention.

## Midterm Folder
The midterm has 2 questions and ones is about Apriori algorithm evaluation and another one is about naive Bayesian classifier. In this repository, there are both questions and my answers in PDF files.

## Final Folder
Actually, the final exam is a course project. I've joined a partnership with my classmate and we worked on sentiment analysis. To make an analysis, we created a web crawler for eksisozluk which is a reddit-like website. Then we mined opinions about a Turkish series on Netflix. Finally, we reached up to 73% accuracy rate, approximately. The mean accuracy was 61%, too.
